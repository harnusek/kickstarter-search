2. Process, create indexes and provide fast scalable search over the data (ElasticSearch) on selected use case (Your choice)
3. Evaluate your solution and highlight some features
    * Need to have min. 6 nontrivial CUSTOM QUERIES (use advanced features as nested, boosted, geo, statistics, autocomplete, proximity etc.) + use Kibana for additional visualizations (min. 3)
    * Need to have min. 3 nontrivial CUSTOM QUERIES (use advanced features as nested, boosted, geo, statistics, autocomplete, proximity etc.) + create custom interface for selected scenarios
4. Describe your project (according steps 1-3) â€“ discuss various settings and respective performance
    * Documentation - include:
    * Queries as formatted text (include as appendix)
    * Mapping as formatted text (include as appendix)
